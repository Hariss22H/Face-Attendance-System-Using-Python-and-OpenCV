## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Face Registration** – Capture and register student images with Enrollment Number & Name.
- 🧠 **Model Training** – Train LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) recognizer on collected images.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition** – Uses Haar cascade for face detection and LBPH for recognition.
- 📊 **Attendance Logging** – Logs timestamped attendance with subject name and auto-generates CSV files.
- 📁 **Excel Export & CSV Viewer** – View and export attendance records with a simple GUI.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Feedback** – System voice guides the user during operations.
- 🎨 **User Interface** – Intuitive Tkinter GUI with themed visual buttons and icons.

## 💡 How It Works

### 📸 Register Faces
Enter student details → Capture 60 face samples per student → Save them for training.

### 🧠 Train Model
Train the **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)** face recognizer using the captured images.

### 🎯 Take Attendance
Start webcam → System detects & recognizes faces → Compares with trained model → Marks students as 'Present' for the selected subject.

### 📊 View Attendance
Browse attendance logs stored by subject & date → Export as CSV files for reporting or analysis.
---
## 📌 Limitations
-Sensitive to lighting and face orientation.

-Requires decent hardware (8 GB RAM & GPU recommended) for smooth real-time processing.
